Image Classification

From Brentwood AI Meetup

I was interested in getting a better understanding of how to use the keras library to perform image classification.

I put together an initial set of files, etc. and enlisted Abdullah Khaled, a colleague, to complete the effort and to
give a presentation at the Brentwood AI Meetup (Brentwood, Tennessee).

The files in this repository contain various python notebooks and the presentation Abdullah put together.

Hopefully, these files will simplify the journey others make take in our footsteps.
